BenchMarking:

time to execute:

(3x3.txt, words.txt) using SortedArrayList: 0.103272208 seconds
(3x3.txt, words.txt) using ArrayListIndexed: 0.200611591 seconds
(3x3.txt, words.txt) using LinkedListIterated: 0.243228559 seconds

(4x4.txt, words.txt) using SortedArrayList: 3.424532679 seconds
(4x4.txt, words.txt) using ArrayListIndexed: 16.964256685 seconds
(4x4.txt, words.txt) using LinkedListIterated: 40.036602589 seconds

Rational:

Only the 3x3 and 4x4 grids were ran because a clear pattern of which methods were
the fastest can be determined from just these two grids. Only these three methods
were chosen because a ArrayListListIterated and a LinkedListIndexed would be
significantly slower and their lack of speed was already established in lab01.

Conclusion:

From this benchmarking it can be concluded that from this given scenario of having to
loop through an existing list, an Indexed ArrayList is faster than an Enhanced 
LinkedList. However, a SortedArrayList that uses binary search is significantly
faster than both of the previous options because it has to check significantly
less Objects than the other two methods.
